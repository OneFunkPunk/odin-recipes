        <h1>Watermelon Cooler Slushy</h1>
        <img src="wl-slushie.jpg">
        <h3>The perfect slushy for lounging on the beach right before the sun sets</h3>
        These delicious slushys are only 79 calories per serving, which in my case 
        means I end up drinking a lot of them !! The slushy is a wonderfully gentle 
        treat to let you beat the heat and relax in peace. This slushy will always 
        put a smile on your face and those of anyone you drink it with as well! 
        If you like watermelons and good drinks, this is for you.
